# Machine Learning for Language identification
This project is about building a Machine Learning model using Neural Networks algorithm for language indentification. The languages to identify are French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. The program is written on Python using mainly Scikit-Learn library
mesFonctions.py contains cleaning text files method and other methods used in the Main.py. There's also a basic GUI in order to do some tests. 

Before starting, it's necessary to download data related to the languages used for this project from :
http://www.statmt.org/europarl/

We only used like it's said before French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. But it can be generalized to all the other languages from the link mentioned above.

The comments in the main program are in French.
